## Status

The project is currently **in progress**, under continuous enhancement, and is regularly updated to better meet the needs of farmers worldwide.

## Inspiration

The developers are from Nepal, a country where agriculture plays a central economic role, with over 63% of national income linked directly or indirectly to farming. Even with such dependence, there was no strong online platform where farmers could openly share their stories, problems, and ideas. PlantXplore was born from the desire to make farming more efficient, informed, and collaborative by giving farmers a dedicated digital home for communication and learning.
